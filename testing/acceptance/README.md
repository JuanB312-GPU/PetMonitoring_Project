# Acceptance Testing in this Folder

This folder contains the acceptance tests for the PetCare Monitor project. Acceptance tests are designed to validate that the system meets the business requirements and user stories from an end-user perspective.

## How Acceptance Tests Are Run

- `validate_framework.py`: Checks that the testing framework and environment are correctly set up before running acceptance tests.
- `test_runner_robust.py`: Executes the acceptance test scenarios, typically using the Behave framework or custom scripts, to simulate real user interactions and validate expected outcomes.

## What Is Tested

Acceptance tests in this folder cover:
- End-to-end user flows (e.g., registering a pet, logging in, generating reports)
- API endpoint validation with real or simulated data
- Business rules and critical scenarios as defined in the requirements
- Error handling and edge cases from a user perspective

## Output

Test results are typically output to the console and may also be saved in files such as `pretty.output` for review.
